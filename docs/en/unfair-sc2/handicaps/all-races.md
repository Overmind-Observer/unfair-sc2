# ALL RACES

*Added in 2.22*

Every selected player has 5 SCV, 5 Zonds and 5 Drones instead of default 12 workers. Optionally it's possible to set that player will have CC, Nexus and Hatchery when the game begin.

Some tech tree requirements are removed:

* Gateway and Forge don't need Nexus.
* Spawn Pool and Evolution Chamber don't need Hatchery.
* Barracks don't need Supply Depot.
* Engineering Bay doesn't need Barracks.

Set to each player individually.

**v3.6**

* [FEATURE] Zergs' Hatchery now is always placed at the player's start point if it's set to create main structures for all races.

**v2.36**

* [FEATURE] Option to give main structures for all races is added

**v2.27**

* [BUGFIX] Now workers are not killed when the game begin
