# WALKING DEAD

*Added in 2.26*

Unit-zombie is spawn after some unit is killed. Zombies are not friendly for any player. Killed workers and units that don't provide or use supply don't create zombies.

It's possible to set such options for zombies:

* Armor (50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%)
* Shields (50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%)
* HP (50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%)
* Attack speed (50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%)
* Move speed (50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%)

Also it's possible to set zombies life time for 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 10m or unlimited. Here time is for "old" game time.

Zombies options are set for all players. However spawn of zombies is set for each player separately.
