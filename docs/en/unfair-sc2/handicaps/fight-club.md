# FIGHT CLUB

*Added in 2.29*

Random units start to fight with each other every 10..60 seconds canceling their current orders. It's possible to set what kind of units will fight (only workers, all, all but not workers) and how many units will fight (10%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%);

Set to each player individually.

* [FEATURE] Visual effect is added for fighting units
* [FEATURE] Units that doesn't use or provide supply now are excluded
* [BUGFIX] Amount of fighting units now is equal to selected option (it was x2).
