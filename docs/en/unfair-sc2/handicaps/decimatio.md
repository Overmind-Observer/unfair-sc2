# DECIMATIO

*Added in 1.31*

Starting from 3:30 every 10th unit is killed every 10..60 seconds (set for each player). Units to kill are selected randomly. For example, you have 18 Zerglings and 2 Brood Lords. Its possible to get both Brood Lords killed.

Workers and cargo units also can be killed. Decimatio doesn't work for structures, larvas, interceptors, units that not use and not provide supply, Overlords and Overseers.
