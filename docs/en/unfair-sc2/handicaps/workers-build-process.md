# WORKERS BUILD PROCESS

*Added in 3.4*

Drones, SCVs and Probes build structures like workers for selected race.

| Selected Race | Behavior                 |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Protoss       | Worker start construction and don't continue it. It won't disappear after construction is completed. |
| Zerg          | Worker participates in the construction and it's removed after construction is completed. |
| Terran        | Worker participates in the construction and it's not removed after construction is completed. |

*Minerals price for structures is reduced for 50 minerals if Zerg race is selected* 

Sometimes build animation may be broken.

Set to each player individually.
