# MINES

*Added in 1.35*

Widow Mines are spawn at the random points of the map. Mines are not spawn in range of 50 (it can be changed) from player's start points. Mines will get upgrade "Drilling Claws" at 6:00 (HotS game timer). Also it's possible to set that extra Mines should spawn after 6:00 at random points.

Mines **ignore** map terrain features and can be placed even in areas inaccessible to ground units.

Every player has a text-block at the top left corner with amount of resources lost because of mines. Spectators have table with data about lost resources for all players.
