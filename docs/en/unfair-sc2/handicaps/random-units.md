Player will get random unit instead of built one. New unit may be same race or any race. Chance to get random unit is set for each player.

Some restrictions:

* T1-units that don't need vespene won't be changed (Marines, Zerglings, Zealots)
* Overlords won't be changed
* Player can get worker instead of produced unit but only for own race
* Mothership won't be changed
* Any unit can't be changed to Mothership 

Set to each player individually.
