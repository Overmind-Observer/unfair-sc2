# LAST WILL

When a unit dies, its killer is dealt damage equal to 50%, 100%, or 200% (set in the handicap menu) of the victimâ€™s maximum health. Only health is considered. Shields are ignored. So, killing an Archon will cause 5/10/20 damage.

In addition to this, you can include a chance for the attacking ability to trigger at the point where the killer unit is located. The chance can be 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%. The ability is randomly selected from the following list:

* Psi Storm 
* Infested Terran Lay Egg
* Vortex
* Blinding Cloud
* Disruption Web
* Point Defense Drone
* Defensive Matrix
* Temporal Field
* Psi Orb
* Graviton Beam
* Yamato Cannon
* Irradiate
* Fungal
* Seeker Missle

Last Will does not work if the player does damage to himself, if the victim is a building or any unit that doesn't use or provide supply.

Set to each player individually.
