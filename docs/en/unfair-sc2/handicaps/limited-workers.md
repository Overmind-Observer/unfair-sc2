# LIMITED WORKERS

*Added in 2.0*

You can set the maximum number of workers that a player can have at the same time. MULES do not count. If there are more workers than allowed, then the extra will be killed.

Set to each player individually.

**v3.5**

* [BUGFIX/REFACTORING] Workers count now is calculated using data-editor and not triggers.

**v3.2**

* [BUGFIX] Workers are no longer destroyed by players for whom this handicap is turned off (bug from 3.0).

**v2.20**

* [FEATURE] In-game hint with handicap's description is added. It's shown only if handicap is turned on at least for one player.
